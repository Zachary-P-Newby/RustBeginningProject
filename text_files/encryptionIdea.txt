Encryption function takes a string, and iterates through it, plugging each letter as a key into a cipher dictionary, where the value is the letter's encrypted equivalent, and concatonating these values into a result string.

Python Version
fn encrypt(str):
	result = ""   
	for letter in str:
		result += cipher[letter]
	return result
